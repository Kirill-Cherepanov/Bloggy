I wrote it before starting the project. Decided to add to repo a bit later though.

Components: Navigation Bar, Footer

Overall design {
	SUPER DEPRICATED
	Dark & Light themes (should probably start with dark and it'll be default)
	Color themes (need colors that will match with dark and light main colors) {
		Dark: 
		Light: 
		(Will need to try different ones and see what goes well)
	}
}

Navigation bar {
	SUPER DEPRICATED
	Design: https://dribbble.com/shots/18444207-Mushroom-Social-Network-for-Gamers (this design seems good but it won't do for the website as a whole because it's based on a totally different concept)
	1. Logo
	2. Search (with different options i.e.: search bloggers/posts, by popularity/new, and others if need be) (search will lead to Posts page)
	3. Navigation: Home, Posts, About, Contacts (here I'll write that this isn't supposed to be an actual business and contacts to myself)
	4. User icon with an arrow down to the right. On click opens block with 
}

Footer (not sure if I need it at all. idk what to put there) {
	SUPER DEPRICATED
	1. Navigation: Home, Posts, About us, Contacts
	2. ...
}

Homepage {
	SUPER DEPRICATED
	1. A hero section {
		Design: https://dribbble.com/shots/17263029-Influencer-Website-Header (something similar)
		Header: Open yourself to the world
		Call to action: Sign up, More about us
		Subheaders {
			Tell your story
			Find your audience
			Turn your thoughts into posts
			Share your knowledge
		}
	}
	2. Our posts
	3 (unlikely). Editor's pick posts
	4. Trending posts by category and a button-link "More posts/More/Other posts/etc." leading to Posts page
	5. Most popular blogs
	* Maybe sidebar if I come up with what to put in there
}

Post {
	1. Return button (will need to store previous location or some other way get it)
	2. Author stuff (idk, maybe it'll be a small inscription) + creation date
	3. Main image
	4. Title
	5. Text (I think it should be written in some sort of compiled text format i.e. .md)
	6. (MAYBE) Color theme of the blogger
	7. More on this blog
	8. Similar posts
}

Userpage {
	0. Chosen blogger's color scheme (color scheme of the website by default)
	1. User card/info (will probably contain username, profile picture, total amount of likes, categories, banner, and a description of the blog) (may take inspiration from osu! profiles and vk profiles)
	2. Posts: blogger can choose how a post will be displayed on his website (Large, Small or Normal (Normal just like that on vk))
	3 VERY UNLIKELY TO BE ADDED ANY TIME SOON. Twitter posts, facebook posts, and posts other popular social media platforms
}

Posts {
	1. Search with filters: blogs/posts, by creation date/popularity over *time*, by categories.
	2. Posts are dynamically loaded
	2.1 No category chosen: PROBABLY Similar to homepage
	2.2 Category(ies) chosen: A semi-chaotic collection of posts. It'll be stated somewhere which category (among chosen ones) this post belongs to (maybe in a header - similar to homepage - or on a post itself)
}

About us:
Some text, some photos maybe, some videos maybe, some reviews maybe

Other pages: Login, Registration, MAYBE Create Post

Backend: Login system - encryption (bcrypt) and database (MongoDB), Website posts - database (MongDB), social media posts - web scraping, authorization - jwt, subscription to bloggers - need to change the db a bit (maybe sql was actually better)
