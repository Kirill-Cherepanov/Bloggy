Overall design {
	Dark & Light themes (should probably start with dark and it'll be default)
	Color themes (need colors that will match with dark and light main colors) {
		Dark: 
		Light: 
		(Will need to try different ones and see what goes well)
	}
}

Navigation bar {
	Design: https://dribbble.com/shots/18444207-Mushroom-Social-Network-for-Gamers (this design seems good but it won't do for the website as a whole because it's based on a totally different concept)
	1. Logo
	2. Search (with different options i.e.: search bloggers/posts, by popularity/new, and others if need be) (search will lead to Posts page)
	3. Navigation: Home, Posts, About, Contacts (here I'll write that this isn't supposed to be an actual business and contacts to myself)
	4. User icon with an arrow down to the right. On click opens block with 
}

SUPER DEPRICATED
Footer (not sure if I need it at all. idk what to put there) {
	1. Navigation: Home, Posts, About us, Contacts
	2. ...
}

SUPER DEPRICATED
Homepage {
	1. A hero section {
		Design: https://dribbble.com/shots/17263029-Influencer-Website-Header (something similar)
		Header: Open yourself to the world
		Call to action: Sign up, More about us
		Subheaders {
			Tell your story
			Find your audience
			Turn your thoughts into posts
			Share your knowledge
		}
	}
	2. Our posts
	3 (unlikely). Editor's pick posts
	4. Trending posts by category and a button-link "More posts/More/Other posts/etc." leading to Posts page
	5. Most popular blogs
	* Maybe sidebar if I come up with what to put in there
}

Post {
	1. Return button (will need to store previous location or some other way get it)
	2. Author stuff (idk, maybe it'll be a small inscription) + creation date
	3. Categories
	4. Main image
	5. Title
	6. Text (I think it should be written in some sort of compiled text format i.e. .md)
	7. (MAYBE) Color theme of the blogger
	8. More on this blog
	9. Similar posts
}

Userpage {
	0. Chosen blogger's color scheme (color scheme of the website by default)
	1. User card/info (will probably contain username, profile picture, total amount of likes, categories, MAYBE banner, and a description of the blog) (may take inspiration from osu! profiles and vk profiles)
	2. Posts: for each post a blogger can choose how a post will be displayed on his website (Large, Small or Normal (Normal just like that on vk))
	3 VERY UNLIKELY TO BE ADDED ANY TIME SOON. Twitter posts, facebook posts, and posts other popular social media platforms
}

Posts {
	1. Search with filters: blogs/posts, by creation date/popularity over *time*, by categories.
	2. Posts are dynamically loaded
	2.1 No category chosen: PROBABLY Similar to homepage
	2.2 Category(ies) chosen: A semi-chaotic collection of posts. It'll be stated somewhere which category (among chosen ones) this post belongs to (maybe in a header - similar to homepage - or on a post itself)
}

About {
	Just some text. Maybe a little formatting.
	Similar to this: https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/about/ with maybe a little more formatting.
	It'll just be similar or the same as the README for the repository, explaining the meaning and purpose of the project, my history with it and plans for the future of this project and maybe my own plans. Idk, maybe just make it a post of its own.
	Or maybe add Subheaders that were originally meant to be on Homepage and make it a continuation of homepage. 
}

Login {
	Just copy basic design from any website that requires authentification (and looks good).
}

Registration {
	Similarly to Login page, just copy it from any good website.
	Also may add an option to choose whether the user wants to start a blog or just wants to be a reader.
}

Create post {
	Not yet sure if a new page will be dedicated to creating posts, but it's most likely to be the case.
	Will probably make it similar to blogger.com or reddit.com or other
}

Settings {
	Each user should be able to choose whether he is a blogger or just a user.
	Entering that you want to be a blogger will add/unlock a settings tab.
	Basic user options: Delete account, update username, update profile picture, update password, update email and an option to create a blog.  
	Blogger options: Delete blog, change blogs theme, change categories, change description, and MAYBE change banner (if banner is added).
}

Backend: Login system - encryption (bcrypt) and database (MongoDB), Website posts - database (MongDB), social media posts - web scraping, authorization - jwt, subscription to bloggers - need to change the db a bit (maybe sql was actually better)
